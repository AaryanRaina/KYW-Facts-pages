              <h1><p class="text-center" style="color:#209FA6">OUR DRUG CULTURE</p></h1><br>
            Drugs have been part of our culture since the middle of the last century. Popularized in the 1960s by music and mass media, they invade all aspects of society.
            <br> <br>
           An estimated 208 million people internationally consume illegal drugs. In the United States, results from the 2007 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">National Survey on Drug Use and Health</span> showed that 19.9 million Americans (or 8% of the population aged 12 or older) used illegal drugs in the month prior to the survey.                
            <br> <br>
            You probably know someone who has been affected by drugs, directly or indirectly.
            <br> <br>
            The most commonly used—and abused—drug in the US is alcohol. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">Alcohol-related motor accidents </span>are the second leading cause of teen death in the United States.

            The most commonly used illegal drug is marijuana. According to the United Nations 2008 World Drug Report, about 3.9% of the world’s population between the ages of 15 and 64 abuse marijuana.

               Young people today are exposed earlier than ever to drugs. Based on a survey by the Centers for Disease Control in 2007, 45% of high school students nationwide <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">drank alcohol </span>and 19.7% smoked pot during a one-month period.             
                <br> <br>
               In Europe, recent studies among 15- and 16-year-olds suggest that use of <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">marijuana</span> varies from under 10% to over 40%, with the highest rates reported by teens in the Czech Republic (44%), followed by Ireland (39%), the UK (38%) and France (38%). In Spain and the United Kingdom, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#209FA6">cocaine</span> use among 15- to 16-year-olds is 4% to 6%. Cocaine use among young people has risen in Denmark, Italy, Spain, UK, Norway and France.  
                <br> <br>
                By the late 1990s, the mortality rate of heroin addicts was estimated to be as high as twenty times greater than the rest of the population.

                <q><em>My goal in life wasn’t living . . . it was getting high. Over the years, I turned to cocaine, marijuana and alcohol under a false belief it would allow me to escape my problems. It just made things worse. I kept saying to myself, I’m going to stop permanently after using one last time. It never happened.</em></q>-<strong>  John </strong>

I had a bad trip one night . . . I prayed and cried for this feeling to go away, I had voices in my head, had the shakes and couldn’t leave home for six months. I thought everyone was watching me. I couldn’t walk in public places. Man! I couldn’t even drive.</em></q>
